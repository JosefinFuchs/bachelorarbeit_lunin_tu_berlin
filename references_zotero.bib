	abstract = {The udkm1Dsim toolbox is a collection of Python classes and routines to simulate the thermal, structural, and magnetic dynamics after laser excitation as well as the corresponding X-ray scattering response in one-dimensional samples, such as multilayers. The toolbox provides the capabilities to define arbitrary layered structures on the atomic level including a rich database of element-specific physical properties. The excitation of dynamics is represented by an N-temperature-model which is commonly applied in ultrafast physics. Structural dynamics due to thermal stresses are calculated by a linear-chain model of masses and springs. The implementation of specific magnetic dynamics can be easily accomplished by the user employing a generalized magnetization interface class. The resulting X-ray diffraction response is computed by kinematical or dynamical X-ray theory which can also include polarization-dependent magnetic scattering. The udkm1Dsim toolbox is highly modular and allows for injecting user-defined inputs at any step within the simulation procedure.
New version program summary
Program Title: udkm1Dsim {CPC} Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/bnzw823v6y.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/dschick/udkm1Dsim Code Ocean capsule: https://codeocean.com/capsule/8131941 Licensing provisions: {MIT} Programming language: Python Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Commun. 185 (2) (February 2014) 651–660 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Reasons for the new version: The toolbox has been ported from {MATLAB} ({MathWorks} Inc.) to Python and is based exclusively on free and open-source components. Moreover, new features have been added that allow for a broader applicability of the toolbox. Summary of revisions: Porting to Python. Introduction of amorphous layers in the sample structures. Add magnetization property to atoms and layers. Multilayer formalism to calculate laser absorption. New magnetization class to allow for user-defined magnetization dynamics. New resonant magnetic X-ray scattering employing dynamical X-ray theory. Calculation of X-ray scattering as function of photon energy and scattering vector. Nature of problem: Simulate the thermal, structural, and magnetic dynamics of 1D layered sample structures due to an ultrafast laser excitation and compute the corresponding transient (magnetic) X-ray scattering response. Solution method: The program provides an object-oriented toolbox for building arbitrary layered 1D crystalline/amorphous sample structures including a rich database of element-specific parameters. The excitation, thermal transport, and lattice dynamics are simulated utilizing {SciPy}'s {ODE} solver. Magnetization dynamics can be introduced by the user employing a magnetization interface class. The dynamical (magnetic) X-ray scattering is computed by a matrix formalism that can be parallelized. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: The program is restricted to 1D layered sample structures. Phonon dynamics only include longitudinal acoustic phonons (sound waves). Magnetization dynamics have to be defined by the user. X-ray scattering only allows for symmetrical and co-planar geometries due to the 1D nature of the toolbox. The program is highly modular and allows the inclusion of user-defined inputs at any time of the simulation procedure.},

	abstract = {{PSI} is developing several new detector families based on charge integration and analog readout ({CI}) to respond to the needs of X-ray free electron lasers ({XFELs}), where a signal up to ∼ 104 photons impinging simultaneously on a pixel make single photon counting detectors unusable. {MÖNCH} is a novel hybrid silicon pixel detector where {CI} is combined with a challengingly small pixel size of 25 × 25 μm2. {CI} enables the detector to process several incoming photon simultaneously in {XFEL} applications. Moreover, due to the small pixel size, the charge produced by an impinging photon is often shared. In low flux experiments the analog information provided by single photons can be used either to obtain spectral information or to improve the position resolution by interpolation. Possible applications are resonant and non-resonant inelastic X-ray scattering or X-ray tomography with X-ray tubes. Two prototype {ASICs} were designed in {UMC} 110 nm technology. {MÖNCH}01 contains only some test cells used to assess technology performance and make basic design choices. {MÖNCH}02 is a fully functional, small scale prototype of 4 × 4 mm2, containing an array of 160 × 160 pixels. This array is subdivided in five blocks, each featuring a different pixel architecture. Two blocks have statically selectable preamplifier gains and target synchrotron applications. In low gain mode they should provide single photon sensitivity (at 6-12 {keV}) as well as a reasonable dynamic range for such a small area ( {\textgreater} 120 photons). In high gain they target high resolution, low flux experiments where charge sharing can be exploited to reach μm resolution. Three other architectures address possible uses at {XFELs} and implement automatic switching between two gains to increase the dynamic range, as well as input overvoltage control. The paper presents the {MÖNCH} project and first results obtained with the {MÖNCH}02 prototype.},

So far, the application of this photon-demanding technique was limited to large-scale facilities. However, upgrades to diffraction-limited storage rings supporting only x-ray pulses beyond 100 ps, and the shift of x-ray free-electron lasers toward attosecond pulses aggravate the competition for beamtime in the picosecond time window, which is of utmost relevance for magnetism research. Here we present the development of a lab-based instrument providing sufficient photon flux up to 1.5 {keV} photon energy covering the soft-x-ray resonances of transition and rare-earth metal atoms. Our setup features the mandatory tunability in energy and reciprocal space in combination with sub-10 ps temporal resolution, exploiting the broadband emission of a laser-driven plasma x-ray source, which is monochromatized to about 1 {eV} bandwidth by a reflection zone plate. We benchmark our approach against accelerator-based soft-x-ray sources by simultaneously probing the laser-induced magnetic and structural dynamics from an antiferromagnetically coupled Fe/Cr superlattice. Our development lays the foundation for laser-driven resonant scattering experiments to study ultrafast ordering phenomena of charges, spins, and orbitals.},

	abstract = {X-ray free electron lasers, with their ultrashort highly coherent pulses, opened up the opportunity of probing ultrafast nano- and atomic-scale dynamics in amorphous and disordered material systems via speckle visibility spectroscopy. However, the anticipated count rate in a typical experiment is usually low. Therefore, visibility needs to be extracted via photon statistics analysis, i.e., by estimating the probabilities of multiple photons per pixel events using pixelated detectors. Considering the realistic X-ray detector responses including charge cloud sharing between pixels, pixel readout noise, and gain non-uniformity, speckle visibility extraction relying on photon assignment algorithms are often computationally demanding and suffer from systematic errors. In this paper, we present a systematic study of the commonly-used algorithms by applying them to an experimental data set containing small-angle coherent scattering with visibility levels ranging from below 1\% to ∼60\%. We also propose a contrast calibration protocol and show that a computationally lightweight algorithm can be implemented for high-speed correlation evaluation.},

In this paper, numerical modeling is presented to show how the data interpretation of visibility spectroscopy can be impacted by the nonidealities of real-life X-ray detectors. Using simulated detector data, this work provides a detailed analysis of the systematic errors of several contrast extraction algorithms in the context of low-count-rate X-ray speckle visibility spectroscopy and their origins are discussed. Here, it was found that the finite detector charge cloud and pixel size lead to an unavoidable `degeneracy' in photon position determination, and that the contrasts extracted using different algorithms can all be corrected by a simple linear model. The results suggest that experimental calibration of the correction coefficient at the count rate of interest is possible and essential.

Here, we utilize coherent X-ray pulses to investigate the sub-100 fs equilibrium dynamics of water from ambient conditions down to supercooled temperatures. This novel approach utilizes the inherent capability of X-ray speckle visibility spectroscopy to measure equilibrium intermolecular dynamics with lengthscale selectivity, by measuring oxygen motion in momentum space. The observed decay of the speckle contrast at the first diffraction peak, which reflects tetrahedral coordination, is attributed to motion on a molecular scale within the first 120 fs. Through comparison with molecular dynamics simulations, we conclude that the slowing down upon cooling from 328 K down to 253 K is not due to simple thermal ballistic-like motion, but that cage effects play an important role even on timescales over 25 fs due to hydrogen-bonding.},

	abstract = {X-ray photon fluctuation spectroscopy using a two-pulse mode at the Linac Coherent Light Source has great potential for the study of quantum fluctuations in materials as it allows for exploration of low-energy physics. However, the complexity of the data analysis and interpretation still prevent recovering real-time results during an experiment, and can even complicate post-analysis processes. This is particularly true for high-spatial resolution applications using {CCDs} with small pixels, which can decrease the photon mapping accuracy resulting from the large electron cloud generation at the detector. Droplet algorithms endeavor to restore accurate photon maps, but the results can be altered by their hyper-parameters. We present numerical modeling tools through extensive simulations that mimic previous x-ray photon fluctuation spectroscopy experiments. By modification of a fast droplet algorithm, our results demonstrate how to optimize the precise parameters that lift the intrinsic counting degeneracy impeding accuracy in extracting the speckle contrast. These results allow for an absolute determination of the summed contrast from multi-pulse x-ray speckle diffraction, the modus operandi by which the correlation time for spontaneous fluctuations can be measured.},

Probes with the ability to see beyond surfaces on nanometer length and subpicosecond time scales can greatly enhance our understanding of these systems and will undoubtedly impact development of future information technologies. Polarized X-rays are an appealing choice of probe due to their penetrating power, elemental and magnetic specificity, and high spatial resolution. The resolution of traditional X-ray microscopes is limited by the nanometer precision required to fabricate X-ray optics. Here we present a novel approach to lensless imaging of an extended magnetic nanostructure, in which a scanned series of dichroic coherent diffraction patterns is recorded and numerically inverted to map its magnetic domain configuration. Unlike holographic methods, it does not require a reference wave or precision optics. In addition, it enables the imaging of samples with arbitrarily large spatial dimensions, at a spatial resolution limited solely by the coherent X-ray flux, wavelength, and stability of the sample with respect to the beam. It can readily be extended to nonmagnetic systems that exhibit circular or linear dichroism. We demonstrate this approach by imaging ferrimagnetic labyrinthine domains in a Gd/Fe multilayer with perpendicular anisotropy and follow the evolution of the domain structure through part of its magnetization hysteresis loop. This approach is scalable to imaging with diffraction-limited resolution, a prospect rapidly becoming a reality in view of the new generation of phenomenally brilliant X-ray sources.},

The small pixel size of this system facilitates charge sharing between pixels, which then can be exploited to gain additional information about the photon absorption position and photon energy. However, for reconstructing complete images from this information, sufficient hits need to be recorded and therefore acquisition times are potentially long. We present a fast read-out system, that is capable of acquiring enough statistics for an image in a few hours in combination with a position reconstruction algorithm, which has the potential to run in a similar amount of time on a fast computing node. We further present results of experiments with a comparable strip detector (small-pitch {GOTTHARD} system) showing that with the aid of single photon interpolation algorithms micron resolution is achievable. Additionally, we show that a similar position reconstruction algorithm works in the two dimensional case for {MÖNCH}.},

	abstract = {The simultaneous retrieval of x-ray attenuation, phase, and scattering using multimodal imaging techniques is finding increasing use in a range of applications, from medicine to materials science. Most techniques rely on the mechanical movement of an optical element (e.g., a grating or a mask) to obtain the multimodal images. While single-shot approaches exist, they typically employ detector pixels smaller than the grating period, often with low detection efficiency, and are limited in resolution unless either the sample or the optical element is displaced in various positions and multiple frames are collected. In this paper, we replace mechanical motion with the {MÖNCH} detector's capability to reach sub-pixel resolutions by interpolating between neighboring pixels collecting the charge generated by a single x-ray event. This enabled us to obtain the pilot demonstration of a laboratory-based high-resolution, single-shot multimodal imaging technique capable of simultaneously retrieving attenuation, directional differential phase, and scatter images, without any mechanical movement. We show that our proof-of-concept setup enables a single-shot resolution of 19.5 
𝜇m

 and that the resulting images provide sufficient information to produce a reliable sample thickness map. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the setup is capable of producing single-shot directional scattering images, while leaving open the option to further increase the resolution by using sample dithering.},

The latest working prototype consists of an array of 400×400 identical pixels for a total active area of 1×1 cm2. Its design is optimized for the single photon regime. An exhaustive characterization of this large area prototype has been carried out in the past months, and it confirms an {ENC} in the order of 35 electrons {RMS} and a dynamic range of ∼4×12 {keV} photons in high gain mode, which increases to ∼100×12 {keV} photons with the lowest gain setting. The low noise levels of {MÖNCH} make it a suitable candidate for X-ray detection at energies around 1 {keV} and below. Imaging applications in particular can benefit significantly from the use of {MÖNCH}: due to its extremely small pixel pitch, the detector intrinsically offers excellent position resolution. Moreover, in low flux conditions, charge sharing between neighboring pixels allows the use of position interpolation algorithms which grant a resolution at the micrometer-level. Its energy reconstruction and imaging capabilities have been tested for the first time at a low energy beamline at {PSI}, with photon energies between 1.75 {keV} and 3.5 {keV}, and results will be shown.},

	abstract = {{PSI} is developing several new detector families based on charge integration and analog readout ({CI}) to respond to the needs of X-ray free electron lasers ({XFELs}), where a signal up to ∼ 104 photons impinging simultaneously on a pixel make single photon counting detectors unusable. {MÖNCH} is a novel hybrid silicon pixel detector where {CI} is combined with a challengingly small pixel size of 25 × 25 μm2. {CI} enables the detector to process several incoming photon simultaneously in {XFEL} applications. Moreover, due to the small pixel size, the charge produced by an impinging photon is often shared. In low flux experiments the analog information provided by single photons can be used either to obtain spectral information or to improve the position resolution by interpolation. Possible applications are resonant and non-resonant inelastic X-ray scattering or X-ray tomography with X-ray tubes. Two prototype {ASICs} were designed in {UMC} 110 nm technology. {MÖNCH}01 contains only some test cells used to assess technology performance and make basic design choices. {MÖNCH}02 is a fully functional, small scale prototype of 4 × 4 mm2, containing an array of 160 × 160 pixels. This array is subdivided in five blocks, each featuring a different pixel architecture. Two blocks have statically selectable preamplifier gains and target synchrotron applications. In low gain mode they should provide single photon sensitivity (at 6-12 {keV}) as well as a reasonable dynamic range for such a small area ( {\textgreater} 120 photons). In high gain they target high resolution, low flux experiments where charge sharing can be exploited to reach μm resolution. Three other architectures address possible uses at {XFELs} and implement automatic switching between two gains to increase the dynamic range, as well as input overvoltage control. The paper presents the {MÖNCH} project and first results obtained with the {MÖNCH}02 prototype.},

	abstract = {{MÖNCH} is a 25 µm-pitch charge-integrating detector aimed at exploring the limits of current hybrid silicon detector technology. The small pixel size makes it ideal for high-resolution imaging. With an electronic noise of about 110 {eV} r.m.s., it opens new perspectives for many synchrotron applications where currently the detector is the limiting factor, e.g. inelastic X-ray scattering, Laue diffraction and soft X-ray or high-resolution color imaging. Due to the small pixel pitch, the charge cloud generated by absorbed X-rays is shared between neighboring pixels for most of the photons. Therefore, at low photon fluxes, interpolation algorithms can be applied to determine the absorption position of each photon with a resolution of the order of 1 µm. In this work, the characterization results of one of the {MÖNCH} prototypes are presented under low-flux conditions. A custom interpolation algorithm is described and applied to the data to obtain high-resolution images. Images obtained in grating interferometry experiments without the use of the absorption grating G2 are shown and discussed. Perspectives for the future developments of the {MÖNCH} detector are also presented.},

	abstract = {Time-resolved resonant magnetic scattering in the soft-x-ray range is a powerful tool for accessing the spatially resolved and element-specific spin dynamics in magnetic materials. So far, the application of this photon-demanding technique was limited to large-scale facilities. However, upgrades to diffraction-limited storage rings supporting only x-ray pulses beyond 100 ps, and the shift of x-ray free-electron lasers toward attosecond pulses aggravate the competition for beamtime in the picosecond time window, which is of utmost relevance for magnetism research. Here we present the development of a lab-based instrument providing sufficient photon flux up to 1.5 {keV} photon energy covering the soft-x-ray resonances of transition and rare-earth metal atoms. Our setup features the mandatory tunability in energy and reciprocal space in combination with sub-10 ps temporal resolution, exploiting the broadband emission of a laser-driven plasma x-ray source, which is monochromatized to about 1 {eV} bandwidth by a reflection zone plate. We benchmark our approach against accelerator-based soft-x-ray sources by simultaneously probing the laser-induced magnetic and structural dynamics from an antiferromagnetically coupled Fe/Cr superlattice. Our development lays the foundation for laser-driven resonant scattering experiments to study ultrafast ordering phenomena of charges, spins, and orbitals.},
