	abstract = {{M√ñNCH}, a charge integrating readout {ASIC} (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) prototype with a pixel pitch of 25 Œºm developed at {PSI}, allows new imaging applications in the field of micron resolution and spectral imaging. The small pixel size of this system facilitates charge sharing between pixels, which then can be exploited to gain additional information about the photon absorption position and photon energy. However, for reconstructing complete images from this information, sufficient hits need to be recorded and therefore acquisition times are potentially long. We present a fast read-out system, that is capable of acquiring enough statistics for an image in a few hours in combination with a position reconstruction algorithm, which has the potential to run in a similar amount of time on a fast computing node. We further present results of experiments with a comparable strip detector (small-pitch {GOTTHARD} system) showing that with the aid of single photon interpolation algorithms micron resolution is achievable. Additionally, we show that a similar position reconstruction algorithm works in the two dimensional case for {M√ñNCH}.},

	abstract = {The simultaneous retrieval of x-ray attenuation, phase, and scattering using multimodal imaging techniques is finding increasing use in a range of applications, from medicine to materials science. Most techniques rely on the mechanical movement of an optical element (e.g., a grating or a mask) to obtain the multimodal images. While single-shot approaches exist, they typically employ detector pixels smaller than the grating period, often with low detection efficiency, and are limited in resolution unless either the sample or the optical element is displaced in various positions and multiple frames are collected. In this paper, we replace mechanical motion with the {M√ñNCH} detector's capability to reach sub-pixel resolutions by interpolating between neighboring pixels collecting the charge generated by a single x-ray event. This enabled us to obtain the pilot demonstration of a laboratory-based high-resolution, single-shot multimodal imaging technique capable of simultaneously retrieving attenuation, directional differential phase, and scatter images, without any mechanical movement. We show that our proof-of-concept setup enables a single-shot resolution of 19.5‚Äâ
ùúám
Œºm
 and that the resulting images provide sufficient information to produce a reliable sample thickness map. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the setup is capable of producing single-shot directional scattering images, while leaving open the option to further increase the resolution by using sample dithering.},

Longitudinal studies following the cause of a disease or evaluating treatment efficacy are of particular interest but challenging due to the small size of the mouse lung and the fast breathing rate. Synchrotron-based in-line phase-contrast computed tomography imaging has been successfully applied in lung research in various applications, but mostly at dose levels that forbid longitudinal in vivo studies. Here, the novel charge-integrating hybrid detector {M√ñNCH} is presented, which enables imaging of mouse lungs at a pixel size of 25‚ÄÖ¬µm, in less than 10‚ÄÖs and with an entrance dose of about 70‚ÄÖ{mGy}, which therefore will allow longitudinal lung disease studies to be performed in mouse models.},

	abstract = {{M√ñNCH} is a hybrid silicon pixel detector based on charge integration and with analog readout, featuring a pixel size of 25√ó25 Œºm2. The latest working prototype consists of an array of 400√ó400 identical pixels for a total active area of 1√ó1 cm2. Its design is optimized for the single photon regime. An exhaustive characterization of this large area prototype has been carried out in the past months, and it confirms an {ENC} in the order of 35 electrons {RMS} and a dynamic range of ‚àº4√ó12 {keV} photons in high gain mode, which increases to ‚àº100√ó12 {keV} photons with the lowest gain setting. The low noise levels of {M√ñNCH} make it a suitable candidate for X-ray detection at energies around 1 {keV} and below. Imaging applications in particular can benefit significantly from the use of {M√ñNCH}: due to its extremely small pixel pitch, the detector intrinsically offers excellent position resolution. Moreover, in low flux conditions, charge sharing between neighboring pixels allows the use of position interpolation algorithms which grant a resolution at the micrometer-level. Its energy reconstruction and imaging capabilities have been tested for the first time at a low energy beamline at {PSI}, with photon energies between 1.75 {keV} and 3.5 {keV}, and results will be shown.},

	abstract = {{PSI} is developing several new detector families based on charge integration and analog readout ({CI}) to respond to the needs of X-ray free electron lasers ({XFELs}), where a signal up to ‚àº 104 photons impinging simultaneously on a pixel make single photon counting detectors unusable. {M√ñNCH} is a novel hybrid silicon pixel detector where {CI} is combined with a challengingly small pixel size of 25 √ó 25 Œºm2. {CI} enables the detector to process several incoming photon simultaneously in {XFEL} applications. Moreover, due to the small pixel size, the charge produced by an impinging photon is often shared. In low flux experiments the analog information provided by single photons can be used either to obtain spectral information or to improve the position resolution by interpolation. Possible applications are resonant and non-resonant inelastic X-ray scattering or X-ray tomography with X-ray tubes. Two prototype {ASICs} were designed in {UMC} 110 nm technology. {M√ñNCH}01 contains only some test cells used to assess technology performance and make basic design choices. {M√ñNCH}02 is a fully functional, small scale prototype of 4 √ó 4 mm2, containing an array of 160 √ó 160 pixels. This array is subdivided in five blocks, each featuring a different pixel architecture. Two blocks have statically selectable preamplifier gains and target synchrotron applications. In low gain mode they should provide single photon sensitivity (at 6-12 {keV}) as well as a reasonable dynamic range for such a small area ( {\textgreater} 120 photons). In high gain they target high resolution, low flux experiments where charge sharing can be exploited to reach Œºm resolution. Three other architectures address possible uses at {XFELs} and implement automatic switching between two gains to increase the dynamic range, as well as input overvoltage control. The paper presents the {M√ñNCH} project and first results obtained with the {M√ñNCH}02 prototype.},

	abstract = {{M√ñNCH} is a 25‚ÄÖ¬µm-pitch charge-integrating detector aimed at exploring the limits of current hybrid silicon detector technology. The small pixel size makes it ideal for high-resolution imaging. With an electronic noise of about 110‚ÄÖ{eV} r.m.s., it opens new perspectives for many synchrotron applications where currently the detector is the limiting factor, e.g. inelastic X-ray scattering, Laue diffraction and soft X-ray or high-resolution color imaging. Due to the small pixel pitch, the charge cloud generated by absorbed X-rays is shared between neighboring pixels for most of the photons. Therefore, at low photon fluxes, interpolation algorithms can be applied to determine the absorption position of each photon with a resolution of the order of 1‚ÄÖ¬µm. In this work, the characterization results of one of the {M√ñNCH} prototypes are presented under low-flux conditions. A custom interpolation algorithm is described and applied to the data to obtain high-resolution images. Images obtained in grating interferometry experiments without the use of the absorption grating G2 are shown and discussed. Perspectives for the future developments of the {M√ñNCH} detector are also presented.},
