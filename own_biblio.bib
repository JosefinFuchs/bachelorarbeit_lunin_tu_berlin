	abstract = {The structural and magnetic properties of two series of [Gd(2, 4 nm)/Fe(t)]n multilayer films with varying Fe thickness were investigated and compared to those of amorphous ferrimagnetic {GdFe} alloys of the same corresponding composition. Transmission electron microscopy studies confirmed the high interface quality of both multilayer series. Furthermore, the microstructure was analyzed, revealing polycrystallinity in both Gd and Fe layers with strong (101¯0)-oriented textured growth of Gd particularly for the multilayer series with 2 nm Gd. Magnetic measurements confirm an out-of-plane magnetic easy axis in the alloy samples and an in-plane magnetic easy axis in all multilayer samples. Twisted spin states in samples with a low remanent magnetization were identified. Magnetic compensation points of both multilayer series are compared to those of the alloy samples. It was found that the dependence of the magnetic compensation point on effective Gd concentration in the series with 2 nm Gd closely resembles the strong dependence observed in the alloy counterparts. In contrast, a weaker dependence is revealed for the multilayer series with 4 nm Gd, which makes this system more robust against variations in composition required for applications.},

	abstract = {{MÖNCH} is a hybrid silicon pixel detector based on charge integration and with analog readout, featuring a pixel size of 25×25 μm2. The latest working prototype consists of an array of 400×400 identical pixels for a total active area of 1×1 cm2. Its design is optimized for the single photon regime. An exhaustive characterization of this large area prototype has been carried out in the past months, and it confirms an {ENC} in the order of 35 electrons {RMS} and a dynamic range of ∼4×12 {keV} photons in high gain mode, which increases to ∼100×12 {keV} photons with the lowest gain setting. The low noise levels of {MÖNCH} make it a suitable candidate for X-ray detection at energies around 1 {keV} and below. Imaging applications in particular can benefit significantly from the use of {MÖNCH}: due to its extremely small pixel pitch, the detector intrinsically offers excellent position resolution. Moreover, in low flux conditions, charge sharing between neighboring pixels allows the use of position interpolation algorithms which grant a resolution at the micrometer-level. Its energy reconstruction and imaging capabilities have been tested for the first time at a low energy beamline at {PSI}, with photon energies between 1.75 {keV} and 3.5 {keV}, and results will be shown.},

They are frequently found in technically relevant systems, to achieve, e.g., high magnetic anisotropy. Magneto-optical methods in the X-ray range are well suited to study complex magnetic materials in an element-speciﬁc way. In this work, we report on recent progress on the quantitative determination of magneto-optical constants of several lanthanides in the soft X-ray region and we show some examples of applications of magneto-optics to hardmagnetic interfaces and exchange-coupled layered structures containing lanthanide elements.},
